# Shell Scripts Repository

Welcome to my Shell Scripts Repository! This repository contains a collection of useful and reusable shell scripts to automate various tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maty-mlln/shell-scripts.git
cd shell-scripts
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts:

```bash
chmod +x src/*
```

And finally, add the `src` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/shell-scripts/src
```

## Scripts

Here is a list of the available scripts in this repository:

1. **clean**: Remove temporary files and directories from the current directory.
2. **push**: Push changes to a Git repository with an automatic detailed commit message.
3. **cs**: A much prettier version of Epitech's `coding-style.sh` script that checks the coding style of C files.

Each script includes comments and usage instructions at the top of the file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a script that you think would be useful to others, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to include a detailed description of the script and its usage.
