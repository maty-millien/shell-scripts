## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Bash scripts that can help you automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and improve your productivity. Each script is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maty-mlln/bash-scripts.git
cd bash-scripts
```

Make sure you have the necessary permissions to execute the scripts:

chmod +x src/*
```

And finally, add the `src` directory to your `PATH` environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/bash-scripts/src
```

## Scripts

Here is a list of the available scripts in this repository:

1. **clean**: Remove temporary files and directories from the current directory.
2. **push**: Push changes to a Git repository with an automatic detailed commit message.
3. **cs**: A much prettier version of Epitech's `coding-style.sh` script that checks the coding style of C files.

Each script includes comments and usage instructions at the top of the file.

## Contributing
